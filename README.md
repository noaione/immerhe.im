## Why?

I was trying to find some domain hacks just for fun and manage to got this since no one seems to claim it yet.

I made the first iteration in one hour since now I have a domain that I don't even know what I'm supposed to do about it.

If anyone wants to use this domain for some project you can reach me out at: `hi@n4o.xyz`
